    <p style="color:black;background-color:lightblue;font-size:13pt;width:100%;font-weight:bold;">Data Structures and Algorithms: Whenever a smart contract is run on the Blockchain, it needs to be executed by each and every computer (node) in the Blockchain. Also, since these operations are executed in a decentralized environment, you generally need to pay a small fee for each transaction that is executed.<br><br>
    Cryptography: Cryptography is one of the key prerequisites of Blockchain development. Blockchain technology relies on asymmetric cryptography for signing and verifying transactions. The blocks are also hashed using a hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash, ensuring that the data/transaction records stored canâ€™t be tampered with.<br><br>
    Blockchain Architecture: Blockchain architecture is the most foundational subject an aspiring Blockchain developer must have a stronghold on. It plays a crucial role in understanding the basic principles and inner workings of the Blockchain. It covers topics like different consensus mechanisms, principles of decentralization, etc.<br><br>
    Smart Contracts: The concept of smart contracts was introduced in the Ethereum Blockchain. A simple explanation of a smart contract is a program or script that runs on the Blockchain, that acts as an intermediary between the two parties involved in a transaction, allowing them to share some services with each other. Simply put, smart contracts can be used to implement business logic on the Blockchain.<br><br>
    Business and Finance: The real-world applications of Blockchain are strongly intertwined with finance and payments. Since Blockchain is extensively in the fintech domain, apart from the obvious technical skills, one also needs to have a strong understanding of how the financial world operates.</p>
